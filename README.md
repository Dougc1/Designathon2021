## Bounce Back Buddy - The healthy lifestyle app
Bounce Back Buddy is your one stop app to get your life back on track in a post-COVID world.

The following repo contains a limited functionality mockup, produced via HTML, CSS, and the p5.js library, meant to be representative of the feel of the finished app. Also available are the inital concept designs provided as images and as a publisher file.

To use, navigate to the html directory and open home.html.

Source code for interactive pages can be found in src. Note it is dependent on p5.js.
